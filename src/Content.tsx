        <p>After several years, I felt like writing something. I had given up blogging several years ago, but recently I felt like reviving my older and younger self. In search of some resilience, I embarked on Imtiaz Ali. Thanks to Facebook, every once in a while, a reel or emotional cinema content reminds me of the revered Indian film director. 

    </p><p>There was Bhansali previously, who seemed to have taken me on a journey of glamour, colour, and lustre. Imtiaz Ali's imagination is a force unique, and powerful. Bhansali's thirst for hurt through the glam of art is one of a kind. Imtiaz, in contrast, seems to target the neural perceptions of humans and question their typical existence
    
    </p><p>We mostly talk about the artists involved in the key roles. A key role usually consumes most of a cinematic experience, leaving a lasting impact. However, we tend to miss out on the imaginative part of cinema. A director puts his imagination into motion through cinema. Direction is the driving force. The script and engineering are elements ultimately coming to life through the eyes of the director. It reminds me of the requirement to have imaginative depth to become a director. 
    
    </p><p>A director must be emotional, driven, and most importantly, have clarity in his imagination, a combination of talents only blessed people have, like Ali, Bhansali, and Tarek Masud. The way Imtiaz thinks of turning the tables every time, in directions turned by -180 degrees, thought jeopardized typically, brings his unforgettable ode to cinema forth. </p></div>
